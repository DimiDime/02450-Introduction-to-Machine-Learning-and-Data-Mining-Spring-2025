# 02450 – Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining (Spring 2025)

Welcome to my repository for the DTU course **02450 – Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining**, taken during **Spring 2025**.  

This course dives into the core principles of **machine learning**, covering both theory and practical applications. You'll find implementations and exercises exploring topics like:

- 🤖 Supervised & Unsupervised Learning  
- 🧮 Model Evaluation and Cross-Validation  
- 📉 Dimensionality Reduction (e.g. PCA)  
- 🔍 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
- 🔬 Clustering, Kernel Density Estimation, and Outlier Detection

We worked hands-on with **Python**, using packages like `NumPy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and custom tools provided by DTU.

## ✨ Project Sneak Peek

Here’s a taste of what you’ll find inside — a visualization from **Project 1**, where we used PCA for exploratory data analysis:
